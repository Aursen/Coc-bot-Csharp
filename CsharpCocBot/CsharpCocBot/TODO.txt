Deployment Considerations
=============================

	» 


ToDo's
=============================

	» [@] Implement Advanced Tab
		- This will contain a bunch of advanced functionality as the name suggests, like:
			- Hability to use presets (Individual Settings)
				- Those are saved as xml files and can be shared among users (loading them)
		- A list with the Building coordinates
			- When selecting the Building on the list, the bot will select it on the game, this way is easier to track if location is wrong and correct it
		- Upgrade Buildings Queue
			- User can select from screen the building (bot will get the coords) to upgrade
			- User must specify the amount of Gold/Elixir required in order to upgrade (say it cost 4M, and user set it to upgrade when it reaches 5M, this way it will not run out of resources to keep the bot from farming)
			- User can specify the order of the queue
			- Bot will have to read if a builder is available
	» [@] Implement Debug Tab
		- Default is hidden, if argument is /debug, then make it visible
	» [@] Implement Spells Tab
		- Set the number of Spells to create per SpellType, useful if you don't have spells and forgot to put them on queue
		- Use of spells?
	» [@] Implement RichTextBox for colored Output
	» [@] Implement Pause button
	» Create the Help Tab
		- [!] It is really needed?


ToDo's In Progress
=============================

	» Make the App Singleton
	» Implement Minimize button
	» Implement TrayIcon
		- Notifications (Alert when Base found)


ToDo's Completed
=============================

	[6.0.0.0]
	» [+] Implement Train Quantity per Troop 
	» [+] Implemented the LogWriter
	» [+] Implemented TaskbarItemInfo Overlay as a visual clue when the Bot is running
	» [+] Make the Start button hidden when clicked, and shown when Stop button is clicked
	» [+] Max Troop Donations Per Request
		- [!] An edit for each troop kind that states maximum number of each troop you can give for each request.
			  So for instance if I push any for barb, arch and gobs, I could set 2/2/1 to avoid give only barbs or wathever come first
			  Or maybe I'm ok to give wizards, but only 1 each request
	» [+] Remember Window Position and more by 'letting' Windows do the job
	» [#] Output messages are now displayed
	» [+] Implementation of UI
	» Initial Release

Known Issues

	» The TextBox will not scroll down to the end if is not visible (another Tab)
		- However, since it will be displaying constantly an output, when focus on the General Tab, it will scroll again to the end
