Deployment Considerations
=============================

	» 


ToDo's
=============================

	» [@] Implement RichTextBox for colored Output
	» [@] Implement Pause button
	» Create the Help Tab
		- [!] It is really needed?


ToDo's In Progress
=============================

	» Make the App Singleton
	» Implement Minimize button
	» Implement TrayIcon
		- Notifications (Alert when Base found)
	» Add calculation below the Troops Percentages
		- The result is the sum of the 3 troops in percentages
			- Display in red if below or major 100%


ToDo's Completed
=============================

	[6.0.0.0]
	» [+] Implemented TaskbarItemInfo Overlay as a visual clue when the Bot is running
	» [+] Make the Start button hidden when clicked, and shown when Stop button is clicked
	» [+] Max Troop Donations Per Request
		- [!] An edit for each troop kind that states maximum number of each troop you can give for each request.
			  So for instance if I push any for barb, arch and gobs, I could set 2/2/1 to avoid give only barbs or wathever come first
			  Or maybe I'm ok to give wizards, but only 1 each request
	» [+] Remember Window Position and more by 'letting' Windows do the job
	» [#] Output messages are now displayed
	» [+] Implementation of UI
	» Initial Release

Known Issues

	» The TextBox will not scroll down to the end if is not visible (another Tab)
