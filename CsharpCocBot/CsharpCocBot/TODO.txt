Deployment Considerations
=============================

	» 


ToDo's
=============================
	» [@] [UI] Implement Advanced Tab
		- This will contain a bunch of advanced functionality as the name suggests, like:
			- Hability to use presets (Individual Settings)
				- Those are saved as xml files and can be shared among users

	» [@] [UI] Implement RichTextBox for colored Output
	» [@] [UI/Code] Implement Pause button
	» [UI] Create the Help Tab
		- [!] It is really needed?

	» [@] [UI] Implement a Debug tab, with a set of customizable buttons (when we can easily change the label). 
		   (This would be displayed only if /debug is appended on the command line.)
	» [@] [Code] Move the common tools that are not CoC or even BlueStack-dependant into a separate dll.
	» [@] [Code] Add some direct C# pixel manipulation instructions, with no use of unmanaged FastFind dll. 	
	» [@] [UI] Add a list of all locatable buildings (barracks, collectors, heroes altars...). 
		Selecting a building will select it in the CoC client
		Double-click (or contextual menu, or explicit button) will allow the change the location (or automatic detection)
	


ToDo's In Progress
=============================

	» [Code] Make the App Singleton

	» [UI] Implement Minimize button
	» [UI] Implement TrayIcon
		- Notifications (Alert when Base found)
	» [Code] Provides an higher level helper for FastFind integration



ToDo's Completed
=============================

	[6.0.0.0]
	» [+] Implement Train Quantity per Troop 
	» [+] Implemented the LogWriter
	» [+] Implemented TaskbarItemInfo Overlay as a visual clue when the Bot is running
	» [+] Make the Start button hidden when clicked, and shown when Stop button is clicked
	» [+] Max Troop Donations Per Request
		- [!] An edit for each troop kind that states maximum number of each troop you can give for each request.
			  So for instance if I push any for barb, arch and gobs, I could set 2/2/1 to avoid give only barbs or wathever come first
			  Or maybe I'm ok to give wizards, but only 1 each request
	» [+] Remember Window Position and more by 'letting' Windows do the job
	» [#] Output messages are now displayed
	» [+] Implementation of UI
	» Initial Release

Known Issues
=============================

	» The TextBox will not scroll down to the end if is not visible (another Tab)
		- However, since it will be displaying constantly an output, when focus on the General Tab, it will scroll again to the end
